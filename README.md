# NMM---Insult-Generator
Generate as many terrible insults in different formats as you could possibly want!

Meant to be run, as is, in the terminal.

Make sure to also download the text file with the insults in it and locate it properly in your filesystem or change line 9 (Should say "FILE_LOCATION_INSULTS = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/InsultWords.txt")") to match where you put the text file.

If you use my code to do something fun or cool, share it with me! Also, credit is nice to have too.
Enjoy!
