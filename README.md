# NMM---Insult-Generator
Generate as many terrible insults in different formats as you could possibly want!

WARNING! I'm not kidding when I say that these insults are terrible. There's some bad bad words in there. Use with caution.

NMM has upgraded! I actually sort of learned how to make exe files and installers so now there is a fancy new installer you can download! Yay!

I'll leave the actual python code in this repository, but it's really just there if you want to mess around with it.

The installer will NOT generate a desktop shortcut automatically so please make sure to go to the installation path and make a desktop shortcut if you want.

Your browser and computer will both probably try to warn you that the installer is not to be trusted. Yes I am not a known app publisher. No my installer will not kill your computer. I promise.

The program will ask you for however many insults you would like it to generate. You can plug in "inf", "infinite", or "infinity" and it will spew out insults until to close the program. If you choose to print infinite insults and you choose the fast type option, you can click anywhere within the window to pause the flow of insults. You can then press enter to start it up again. Fast speed prints too fast to read so I recommend doing slow speed for infinite.

If you use my code to do something fun or cool, share it with me! Also, credit is nice to have too.
Enjoy!
